    Parameters
    ----------
    datapipe : DataPipe
        The datapipe.
    feature_store : FeatureStore
        A storage for features, support read and update.
    node_feature_keys : List[str] or Dict[str, List[str]]
        Node features keys indicates the node features need to be read.
        - If `node_features` is a list: It means the graph is homogeneous
        graph, and the 'str' inside are feature names.
        - If `node_features` is a dictionary: The keys should be node type
        and the values are lists of feature names.
    edge_feature_keys : List[str] or Dict[str, List[str]]
        Edge features name indicates the edge features need to be read.
        - If `edge_features` is a list: It means the graph is homogeneous
        graph, and the 'str' inside are feature names.
        - If `edge_features` is a dictionary: The keys are edge types,
        following the format 'str:str:str', and the values are lists of
        feature names.
